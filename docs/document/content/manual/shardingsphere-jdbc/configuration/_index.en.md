## Introduction

As the core of ShardingSphere-JDBC, configuration is the only module in ShardingSphere-JDBC that has something to do with application developers. Configuration module is also the portal of ShardingSphere-JDBC, through which users can fast and clearly understand the functions provided by ShardingSphere-JDBC.

This part is a configuration manual for ShardingSphere-JDBC, which can also be referred to as a dictionary if necessary.

ShardingSphere-JDBC has provided 4 kinds of configuration methods for different situations. By configuration, application developers can flexibly use sharding databases with sharding tables, read-write split or the combination of both.
